# Privacy Policy - DreamJournal AI

**Last Updated: December 23, 2025**

## 1. Overview

DreamJournal AI ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

## 2. Data Collection and Storage

**Local Storage:** We prioritize your privacy by designing DreamJournal AI as a "Local-First" application. All dream entries, personal notes, and user settings are stored directly on your device using on-device storage mechanisms. We do not maintain a central database of your personal journal entries.

**Cloud Sync (Optional):** If you choose to sign in with Google or Apple, your dreams may be synced to our secure cloud storage (Firebase) to enable cross-device access. This data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

**Deletion:** You retain full control over your data. You may delete individual entries or clear all data via the App Settings at any time. You may also delete your cloud account entirely from within the app. Uninstalling the application will permanently remove all locally stored data.

## 3. AI Analysis and Third-Party Processing

**Google Gemini API:** To provide dream interpretation features, the text of your specific dream entry is transmitted to Google's Gemini API for processing.

**Data Handling:** We transmit this data anonymously, without attaching your name, email, or other personally identifiable information (PII). We configure our API requests to request that your data is not used to train Google's machine learning models, subject to Google's applicable data processing terms. We do not sell your personal data.

## 4. Advertising

**AdMob:** We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data to serve personalized ads. You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings or by responding to the App Tracking Transparency prompt on iOS.

## 5. Analytics and Crash Reporting

We may collect anonymous, aggregated usage data (e.g., session length, crash reports) through Firebase Analytics to improve app stability and performance. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.

## 6. In-App Purchases

Subscription purchases are processed by Apple's App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Purchase records are managed through RevenueCat to verify subscription status.

## 7. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
